# Basic-App-Tests

Just a repository with code I'm using to to practice development for android using Kotlin+xml, Java+xml, Swift, and objective-C

<b>Completed:</b><br>
Kotlin+xml for Android

Next up:<br>
Java+xml

## The process
The app took about 2 hours to make <br>
I had a bit of trouble adapting to xml with a big issue slowing me down was not realizing I accidentally closed a LinearLayout <br>
It was really fun to learn this stuff. Working with user input is much easier here than in Jetpack Compose.
